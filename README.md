# Portfolio Frontend
## Overview
### This repository, portfolio-frontend, contains the frontend code for a personal portfolio website. It's built using React, TypeScript, and Vite, offering a modern, efficient, and scalable web application.

## Integration with Backend
- ### The frontend is designed to seamlessly integrate with the backend, [Portfolio Backend Repository](https://github.com/krasenHristov/portfolio-backend). The backend is responsible for storing and serving all of the data displayed on the frontend.
